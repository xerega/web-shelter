# Web Shelter

## What is Web Shelter?

Web Shelter is my thesis project at my university. The idea of this application is similar to Duolingo's: create a new habit, spend time productively, study something new. In Duolingo you study foreign languages, in Web Shelter you study HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.

## Technologies

Web Shelter will consist of two parts: client and server.

### Client

For the client side of Webber I am going to use:

- Vue.js and its ecosystem
- TailwindCSS or some component library (Vuetify, Quasar or NuxtUI)

### Server

For the server side of Webber I am going to use:

- Nest.js
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Websockets
